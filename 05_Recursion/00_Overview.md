# Recursion üêâ

There are a few ways of solving problems, the non-recursive way ie. iteration methods, loops, etc..

Or **RECURSION**

Recursion is a process or function that calls itself until a base case is satisfied

Sometimes it can be a more effective alternative to iteration, and in this section we'll learn how to identify problems that would be good candidates for recursion to solve
