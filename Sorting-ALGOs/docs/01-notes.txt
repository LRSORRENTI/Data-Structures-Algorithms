taking an array or set of data, and organizing it 
the way we want with some kind of order 

- Sort numbers in ascending or descending order 

- Sort data alphabetically 

- Sort movies based on release year or revenue

Why learn this?
===============

- Sorting is incredibly common across all programming 
  domains, it's a great tool to have 

- There are many ways to sort data, some have 
  advantages over another, sometimes heap sort is 
  faster than insertion sort, and vice versa, and this is 
  true for all of the sorting algos, depending on 
  the task, one may be better than another
